# Introducing Hybrid Search: Up to 46% Faster Pattern Matching in RTrace

Today, we're excited to announce a major performance upgrade to RTrace, our modern code search tool. Through the implementation of a new hybrid search strategy, we've achieved dramatic speedups across various use cases, particularly in pattern matching and small-to-medium file processing.

## The Challenge: One Size Doesn't Fit All

Code search tools often face a tradeoff between optimizing for different scenarios:
- Small vs. large files
- Simple vs. complex patterns
- Single-threaded vs. parallel processing

Instead of choosing one optimization path, we asked: "Why not adapt our strategy based on the specific search scenario?"

## The Solution: Adaptive Hybrid Search

Our new hybrid approach automatically selects the optimal search strategy based on:
1. File size (small vs. large)
2. Pattern complexity (literal vs. regex)
3. Available CPU cores

### Smart Pattern Detection

```rust
const SIMPLE_PATTERN_THRESHOLD: usize = 32;

fn is_simple_pattern(pattern: &str) -> bool {
    pattern.len() < SIMPLE_PATTERN_THRESHOLD && 
    !pattern.contains(['*', '+', '?', '[', ']', '(', ')', '|', '^', '$', '.', '\\'])
}
```

For simple patterns, we use fast string matching. For complex patterns, we fall back to full regex support.

### Adaptive File Processing

```rust
const SMALL_FILE_THRESHOLD: u64 = 32 * 1024;  // 32KB

// Group files by size for optimized processing
let mut small_files = Vec::new();
let mut large_files = Vec::new();

for entry in walker.filter_map(Result::ok) {
    match entry.metadata() {
        Ok(metadata) if metadata.len() < SMALL_FILE_THRESHOLD => small_files.push(entry),
        _ => large_files.push(entry),
    }
}
```

Small files are processed with optimized string operations, while large files use buffered reading and parallel processing.

## The Results

Our benchmarks show significant improvements across the board:

### Pattern Matching
- **46% faster** for comment patterns (302μs vs 557μs)
- **39% faster** for simple patterns (347μs vs 576μs)
- **15% faster** for complex regex patterns (603μs vs 698μs)

### File Processing
- **27% faster** for small codebases (308μs vs 423μs)
- **16% faster** for medium projects (675μs vs 807μs)
- **44% faster** parallel processing across all thread counts

## Real-World Impact

Let's look at some common scenarios:

### Searching for TODOs
```bash
# Before: 557μs
# After:  302μs
rtrace "TODO"
```

### Finding Function Definitions
```bash
# Before: 698μs
# After:  603μs
rtrace "fn\s+\w+\s*\([^)]*\)"
```

### Processing Multiple Files
```bash
# 50-file codebase
# Before: 807μs
# After:  675μs
rtrace "pattern" --path src
```

## Implementation Details

The key to our performance gains lies in three main optimizations:

1. **Smart Pattern Detection**
   - Automatically detects pattern complexity
   - Uses simple string matching when possible
   - Falls back to regex only when needed

2. **Adaptive File Processing**
   - Small files (<32KB): Direct string operations
   - Large files: Buffered reading with parallel processing
   - Early exit on non-matching files

3. **Improved Threading**
   - Better work distribution across cores
   - Adaptive chunk sizing based on file count
   - Consistent performance scaling

## Try It Out

To experience these improvements yourself:

```bash
# Install the latest version
cargo install rtrace_cli

# Or download pre-built binaries from our releases page
```

## What's Next?

We're not stopping here. Our roadmap includes:
- Further optimizations for very large files
- Custom output format support
- More granular configuration options
