# Multi-Pattern Replacement: Streamlined Code Updates

We're excited to announce a significant enhancement to RustScout's **replacement functionality**: the ability to handle **multiple pattern replacements in a single pass**. This update, along with several code modernization improvements, makes RustScout even more powerful for large-scale codebase modifications.

---

## 1. Introduction

Our recent work has focused on two main areas:
- Implementing efficient multi-pattern replacement
- Modernizing the codebase to use our new pattern definition system

These changes make RustScout more powerful while maintaining its reliability and performance. Let's dive into the details of what's new.

## 2. Multi-Pattern Replacement

The headline feature is the ability to replace multiple patterns in a single pass. This is particularly useful for:
- Refactoring multiple related terms simultaneously
- Updating multiple API references at once
- Performing complex codebase migrations efficiently

### Implementation Details

The new system processes multiple patterns in one pass through each file, which:
- Reduces I/O operations
- Maintains consistent ordering of replacements
- Prevents conflicts between replacements

Example usage with the new CLI flags:
```bash
# Replace multiple patterns at once
rustscout-cli replace \
  --pattern "oldAPI" --replacement "newAPI" \
  --pattern "deprecatedFunc" --replacement "modernFunc" \
  --pattern "legacyType" --replacement "CurrentType"
```

## 3. Code Modernization

We've undertaken a significant modernization effort in our codebase:

### Pattern Definition System

The new `PatternDefinition` struct provides a more robust way to define search and replace patterns:
```rust
pub struct PatternDefinition {
    pub pattern: String,
    pub word_boundary_mode: WordBoundaryMode,
    pub hyphen_handling: HyphenHandling,
    // Additional configuration...
}
```

This structure:
- Encapsulates all pattern-related settings
- Provides clear validation rules
- Supports advanced features like word boundary handling

### Replacement Configuration

The `ReplacementConfig` has been updated to use the new pattern system:
```rust
pub struct ReplacementConfig {
    pub pattern_definitions: Vec<PatternDefinition>,
    // Other configuration options...
}
```

This change:
- Supports multiple patterns efficiently
- Provides a foundation for future enhancements

## 4. Performance Improvements

The new multi-pattern system is designed for efficiency:

### Single-Pass Processing
- Files are read only once for multiple patterns
- Memory usage is optimized
- I/O operations are minimized

### Smart Pattern Matching
- Patterns are compiled once and reused
- Word boundaries are handled efficiently
- Hyphenation rules are applied consistently

---

## 5. Future Plans

While these improvements significantly enhance RustScout's capabilities, we're already planning future enhancements:

1. **Pattern Groups**
   - Group related patterns together
   - Apply conditional replacements
   - Support pattern dependencies

2. **Enhanced Preview**
   - Show all pattern matches in context
   - Highlight different patterns distinctly
   - Interactive pattern selection

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel pattern matching
   - Smarter pattern ordering
   - Memory usage optimization

## Conclusion

These updates make RustScout more powerful and easier to use for complex codebase modifications. Whether you're updating API references, refactoring variable names, or performing large-scale migrations, RustScout now handles multiple patterns more efficiently than ever.

Try out the new multi-pattern replacement feature and let us know what you think. Your feedback helps us continue improving RustScout for everyone.

### Quick Start

Here are some examples to get you started with the new features:
```bash
# Replace multiple patterns with preview
rustscout-cli replace \
  -p "oldAPI" -r "newAPI" \
  -p "legacyFunc" -r "modernFunc" \
  --preview

# Use word boundaries and hyphen handling
rustscout-cli replace \
  -p "user" -r "customer" --word-boundary \
  -p "data-type" -r "dataType" --handle-hyphens

# Multiple patterns with backup
rustscout-cli replace \
  -p "v1" -r "v2" \
  -p "beta" -r "stable" \
  --backup
```

**Happy replacing with RustScout!**
