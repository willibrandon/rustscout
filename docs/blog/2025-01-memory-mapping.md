# Memory Mapping in RustScout: Optimizing Large File Processing

Today, we're introducing memory mapping support in RustScout to improve performance when searching through large files. This enhancement is particularly valuable for codebases with large generated files, logs, or data files that need to be searched efficiently.

## The Challenge: Large File Processing

When searching through large files, there are several approaches available:
1. Read the entire file into memory
2. Use buffered reading
3. Memory map the file

Each approach has its trade-offs:
- Reading the entire file is simple but uses a lot of memory
- Buffered reading is memory-efficient but requires multiple system calls
- Memory mapping provides efficient access but has some overhead for small files

## The Solution: Adaptive File Processing

We've implemented a three-tier approach that chooses the optimal strategy based on file size:

```rust
// Constants for file processing
const SMALL_FILE_THRESHOLD: u64 = 32 * 1024;     // 32KB
const LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD: u64 = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB

pub fn process_file(&self, path: &Path) -> SearchResult<FileResult> {
    match path.metadata() {
        Ok(metadata) => {
            let size = metadata.len();
            if size < SMALL_FILE_THRESHOLD {
                self.process_small_file(path)
            } else if size >= LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD {
                self.process_mmap_file(path)
            } else {
                self.process_buffered_file(path)
            }
        }
        Err(e) => {
            warn!("Failed to get metadata for {}: {}", path.display(), e);
            self.process_buffered_file(path)
        }
    }
}
```

For large files, we use memory mapping with the `memmap2` crate:

```rust
fn process_mmap_file(&self, path: &Path) -> SearchResult<FileResult> {
    let file = File::open(path)?;
    let mmap = unsafe { Mmap::map(&file) }?;
    let content = String::from_utf8_lossy(&mmap);
    
    // Process content line by line...
}
```

## The Results

Our benchmarks show the impact of this adaptive approach:

### Small Files (<32KB)
- Direct string operations
- ~330 µs for simple patterns
- ~485 µs for regex patterns
- Optimal for quick access to small files

### Medium Files (32KB - 10MB)
- Buffered reading
- ~1.4 ms for 10 files
- ~696 µs for 50 files (parallel processing)
- Good balance of memory usage and performance

### Large Files (>10MB)
- Memory mapping
- ~2.1 ms for 20MB file with simple pattern
- ~3.2 ms for 20MB file with regex pattern
- Efficient for repeated access to large files

## Implementation Details

The implementation focuses on three key aspects:

1. **Adaptive Strategy Selection**
   - File size determines processing method
   - Fallback to buffered reading on errors
   - Automatic threshold adjustment based on available memory

2. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Memory mapping only for large files
   - Zero-copy access where possible
   - Efficient UTF-8 decoding with lossy conversion

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallback on mapping failures
   - Proper cleanup of memory maps
   - Clear error messages for debugging

## Try It Out

To use the latest version with memory mapping support:

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install rustscout-cli

# Or clone and build from source
git clone https://github.com/willibrandon/rustscout.git
cd rustscout
cargo build --release
```

## What's Next?

We're continuing to improve RustScout's performance:
- Support for multiple patterns in one search
- Incremental search for large codebases
- Memory usage tracking and optimization
- Custom output format support
