# Memory Metrics in RustScout: Understanding and Optimizing Resource Usage

Today, we're introducing comprehensive memory usage tracking in RustScout. This feature provides detailed insights into how our code search tool uses memory, helping developers understand and optimize resource usage in their search operations.

## The Challenge: Understanding Memory Usage

When searching through large codebases, memory usage can be significant and unpredictable. Different search patterns, file sizes, and processing strategies all affect memory consumption differently. Without proper tracking, it's difficult to:
- Identify memory bottlenecks
- Optimize resource usage
- Make informed decisions about processing strategies
- Monitor system impact

## The Solution: Comprehensive Memory Metrics

We've implemented a new `MemoryMetrics` system that tracks various aspects of memory usage:

```rust
pub struct MemoryMetrics {
    // Memory usage metrics
    total_allocated: Arc<AtomicU64>,
    peak_allocated: Arc<AtomicU64>,
    mmap_allocated: Arc<AtomicU64>,
    cache_size: Arc<AtomicU64>,

    // Cache metrics
    cache_hits: Arc<AtomicU64>,
    cache_misses: Arc<AtomicU64>,

    // File processing metrics
    small_files_processed: Arc<AtomicU64>,
    buffered_files_processed: Arc<AtomicU64>,
    mmap_files_processed: Arc<AtomicU64>,
}
```

The metrics system is thread-safe and provides real-time tracking of:
1. Memory allocations and deallocations
2. Peak memory usage
3. Memory-mapped regions
4. Pattern cache performance
5. File processing strategies

## Implementation Details

### Memory Allocation Tracking

```rust
pub fn record_allocation(&self, bytes: u64) {
    let total = self.total_allocated.fetch_add(bytes, Ordering::Relaxed) + bytes;
    let mut peak = self.peak_allocated.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    while total > peak {
        match self.peak_allocated.compare_exchange_weak(
            peak,
            total,
            Ordering::Relaxed,
            Ordering::Relaxed,
        ) {
            Ok(_) => break,
            Err(current) => peak = current,
        }
    }
    debug!("Memory allocated: {} bytes, total: {} bytes", bytes, total);
}
```

### File Processing Metrics

```rust
pub fn record_file_processing(&self, size: u64) {
    if size < SMALL_FILE_THRESHOLD {
        self.small_files_processed.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    } else if size >= LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD {
        self.mmap_files_processed.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    } else {
        self.buffered_files_processed.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    }
}
```

### Cache Performance Tracking

```rust
pub fn record_cache_operation(&self, size_delta: i64, hit: bool) {
    if size_delta > 0 {
        self.cache_size.fetch_add(size_delta as u64, Ordering::Relaxed);
    } else {
        self.cache_size.fetch_sub((-size_delta) as u64, Ordering::Relaxed);
    }

    if hit {
        self.cache_hits.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    } else {
        self.cache_misses.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
    }
}
```

## Real-World Impact

The metrics system provides valuable insights into search operations:

### Memory Usage Patterns
- Track peak memory usage during large searches
- Monitor memory-mapped file regions
- Understand pattern cache growth

### Processing Strategy Effectiveness
- See how many files use each processing strategy
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Identify potential optimization opportunities

### Performance Insights
```
Memory usage stats:
Total allocated: 1,234,567 bytes
Peak allocated: 2,345,678 bytes
Memory mapped: 10,485,760 bytes
Cache size: 12,345 bytes
Cache hits/misses: 456/123
Files processed (small/buffered/mmap): 789/456/123
```

## Integration with Existing Features

The metrics system complements our existing optimizations:
1. **Pattern Caching**: Track cache effectiveness and memory impact
2. **Memory Mapping**: Monitor mapped regions and their lifecycle
3. **Hybrid Search**: Understand strategy selection impact

## Try It Out

The metrics are available in the latest version:

```rust
let config = SearchConfig {
    pattern: String::from("TODO"),
    root_path: PathBuf::from("src"),
    stats_only: true,  // Include memory stats in output
    ..Default::default()
};

let result = search(&config)?;
println!("Memory stats: {:?}", result.metrics);
```

## What's Next?

We're planning several enhancements:
1. Prometheus-style metrics export
2. Memory usage alerts and recommendations
3. More detailed allocation tracking
4. Custom metric collection plugins
